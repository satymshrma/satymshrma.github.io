<!--## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/satymshrma/satymshrma.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/satymshrma/satymshrma.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Satyam. I'm an undergraduate student, studying computer science in Dehradun, Uttrakhand, India.

I like to work with front end technologies. I like to work on software that directly interacts with the people using it.

I have a vested interest in UX/UI and am a hobby/novice/aspirant game dev.

I am currently studying web based technologies.

I also like anime, xainxia, to draw & make 3D models in Blender.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at [@satymshrma](https://t.me/satymshrma) on Telegram, else, mail me at satyamsharma.geu@gmail.com

Below are my repositories. _(They are a bit messy, and at some places a little incomplete. But I'm working on it, so just bear with me for the while. <3)_
